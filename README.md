# Internal Security Audit

## Objective

The purpose of the Internal Security Audit was to familiarize myself with the different elements that make up an audit and what to look for when wanting to help an organization to strengthen their security posture. In addition, it helped me to understand how an organization's security posture is conneted to complying with laws and regulations. 

### What I Learned

- The different elements that make up an organization's security posture and how they help keep an organization safe. 
- Differet laws/regualtaions that Botium Toys needed to comply with and how they could start doing so.
- The various steps involved in an internal security audit. 
- How to summarize the security audit in order for it to be clear to undertand. 


### Tools Used

- I used the "Control Categories" provided by google to better understand the tools Botium Toys (and by extension all companies) can use to have a better security posture.
- I used the "Controls and compliance checklist exeplar" to compare my work and see in what areas of my work I can make imporvments.

- I first went through the "Controls Assessment Checklist" to see what kind of controls Botium Toys had in place and what they needed.

- Then, I looked to see how customer PIIs are being handled and whether or not the company is complying with current regulations regarding customer PIIs.

- Next, I decided to write the recommendations I encouraged Botium Toys to make to its system in order to strengthen their security posture.
- To begin my recommendations I first wrote the benefits of making the improvemtents and why it was necessary.
- I also clearly wrote the level of risk the company faces and the reasons why.

 - Lastly, I compared my work to the exemplar given to me to see the improvments I could make to my work.
